            <h1>Mars</h1>
            <p>Mars is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest to the Sun. Its orbit around the Sun takes 87.97 <br> Earth days, the shortest of all the Sun's planets. It is named after the Roman god Mercurius <br> (Mercury), god of commerce, messenger of the gods, and mediator between gods and mortals, <br>corresponding to the Greek god Hermes (Ἑρμῆς). Like Venus, Mercury orbits the Sun within Earth's<br> orbit as an inferior planet, and its apparent distance from the Sun as viewed from Earth never<br> exceeds 28°. This proximity to the Sun means the planet can only be seen near the<br> western horizon after sunset or the eastern horizon before sunrise, usually in twilight.<br> At this time, it may appear as a bright star-like object, but is more <br>difficult to observe than Venus. From Earth, the planet telescopically displays the<br> complete range of phases, similar to Venus and the Moon, which recurs over its synodic period of approximately 116 days. <br>The synodic proximity of Mercury to Earth makes Mercury most of the time Earth's closest planet, <br>despite Venus at times approaching Earth closer than any other planet can.</p>
            <h1></h1>
            <p>The atmosphere of the Earth consists mostly of nitrogen and oxygen. Greenhouse gases in  the atmosphere like carbon <br> dioxide (CO2) trap a part of the energy from the Sun close to the surface. Water vapor <br> is widely present in the atmosphere and forms clouds that cover most of the planet. More solar energy <br> is received by tropical regions than polar regions and is redistributed by atmospheric <br> and ocean circulation. A region's climate is governed not only by latitude but also by elevation <br> and proximity to moderating oceans. In most areas, severe weather, such as tropical <br> cyclones, thunderstorms, and heatwaves, occurs and greatly impacts life.</p>
