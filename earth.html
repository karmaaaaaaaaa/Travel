            <h1>Earth</h1>
            <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. While large volumes <br> of water can be found throughout the Solar System, only Earth sustains liquid surface <br> About 71% of Earth's surface is made up of the ocean, dwarfing Earth's polar ice, lakes, and rivers. <br> The remaining 29% of Earth's surface is land, consisting of continents and islands. <br> Earth's surface layer is formed of several slowly moving tectonic plates, which interact to produce <br> mountain ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes. Earth's liquid outer core generates the <br> magnetic field that shapes the magnetosphere of the Earth, deflecting destructive solar winds.</p>
            <h1></h1>
            <p>The atmosphere of the Earth consists mostly of nitrogen and oxygen. Greenhouse gases in  the atmosphere like carbon <br> dioxide (CO2) trap a part of the energy from the Sun close to the surface. Water vapor <br> is widely present in the atmosphere and forms clouds that cover most of the planet. More solar energy <br> is received by tropical regions than polar regions and is redistributed by atmospheric <br> and ocean circulation. A region's climate is governed not only by latitude but also by elevation <br> and proximity to moderating oceans. In most areas, severe weather, such as tropical <br> cyclones, thunderstorms, and heatwaves, occurs and greatly impacts life.</p>
